                    <h2>Low Cost Clay Mixing Device</h2>

                        <p> Prior to shaping clay, a crucial step in ceramics is preparing the clay through a process known as wedging. This task, as I've learned from personal experience and anecdotes from others, can be quite strenuous and taxing on the hands. Recognizing the need to alleviate the challenges associated with wedging and recycling clay, this project introduces a design for a cost-effective, smaller-scale alternative to the pug mill. The user would either crank the device by hand or foot to mix clay. However, testing results indicate that the current iteration of the design falls short in effectively mixing recycled clay. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If I were to pursue this project further, I would conduct additional testing to introduce more parameters such as clay consistency to develop a more comprehensive  model of the system. I would also consider incorporating gears to my design to increase mechanical advantage and reduce the user input force.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This project incorporated machining skills using every equipment in the makerspace at Harvard. More importantly, I learned the importance of sharing ideas and reaching out for help in engineering. 

                        Here are some figures from my report below.

                        <p>This project simulates different impact speeds and angles of a micrometereoid and their effects on a spacecraft in Lower Earth Orbit using an Abaqus explicit dynamic simulation. While there is a general trend of the hole size increasing with micrometeoroid velocity and angle of impact, the simulations show that satellites have little concern for the potential of sustaining large ruptures or changes in trajectory from micrometeoroids.

                            Mantis shrimp are known for generating ultrafast and powerful strikes to crush their prey's shells. As an undergraduate researcher, I joined in a couple of projects to develop mantis shrimp-inspired tiny robots.
                            <br><br>
                            The goal of my first project was to create the world's highest jumping microrobot. I developed a novel design that integrated the mantis shrimp's striking mechanism with a straight bar linkage for the jumping motion.
                            <br><br>
                            In the second project, we improved the original mantis shrimp microrobot to maximize striking velocities, achieving a 53% improvement in striking performance, with the fastest tip velocity exceeding 40 m/s. These achievements were published

                            here</a> at the 2022 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems.
                                <br><br>
                            In both projects, I manufactured countless of paper and carbon fiber prototypes using laser-cut laminated materials that were assembled to form 3D models. Additionally, I created a parametrized model of the robot to analyze its inertial changes as parameters varied and designed experimental setups to record and analyze the robot's jumping performance.

                        <p>I fell in love with pottery making junior year of college. My dorm had an in-house pottery studio that was offering classes to beginners so I signed up. I continued taking pottery lessons the next semester and over the summer. I ended up becoming the dormitory pottery studio manager in my senior year! The craft perfectly encapsulate a satisfying mixture of arts, science, and engineering. One of my favorite aspects about pottery is envisioning how people interact with my work. I always find ways to revise and improve my pieces for the next time I make them after using them.

                        <p>Boop It, inspired by the classic game Bop It, is a handheld game device with 7 fun dog themed commands such as “boop it”, “wiggle it” and “bark at it.” An Arduino MKRZero interprets several analog and digital inputs from various components such as switches, sensors, and an IMU. The game features OLED displays and audio tracks stored on an SD card for easy command viewing and listening. The score accumulates as the player finishes task after task. A high score rewards players with encouragement, while a lower score subjects them to a rickroll. Boop It is an incredibly fun, family-friendly, soon-to-be award winning game that will surely win everyone’s dog loving hearts.

                    <h2>Screw-Lid Jar Opener</h2>

                        <p>Opening screw lid containers such as a plastic water bottle or a glass jar requires a twisting force that can be unachievable especially for elders or others with dexterity issues. After assessing various designs, building foam core prototypes, and evaluating them based on 11 criteria, my teammate and I made a robot that surpassed the minimum torque of 1Nm to open a sealed water bottle in under 5 seconds. This robot accommodates for different container sizes, ranging from 1 to 3.5 inch diameters, allowing the users to utilize it for various household items. Besides its twisting ability, the robot firmly secures containers in their place, reducing the chances of slippage or breakage. This course was taken remotely so fabrication techniques were limited to laser cutting and 3D printing. This project won first place in the pitch competition held at the end of the semester!
                        <br><br>
                        This course was my first introduction to mechanical engineering and influenced me to switch my major from physics to mechanical engineering in sophomore fall!
